## Description

Homework 3 consists of coding assignments and math problems covering concepts on Gaussian distributions and classifiers. The main tasks include:

1. **Gaussian Classification**:
   - Derive and implement Gaussian classifiers for a two-class, one-dimensional classification problem.
   
2. **Classification and Risk**:
   - Develop a decision rule to minimize risk in a classification problem with multiple classes and a "doubt" category.
   
3. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Bias**:
   - Derive MLE for mean and variance for a given distribution and analyze the bias of the estimators.
   
4. **Covariance Matrices and Decompositions**:
   - Estimate the covariance matrix for multivariate normal distributions and handle cases where the matrix is singular.
   
5. **Isocontours of Normal Distributions**:
   - Plot isocontours for given normal distributions using various parameters.
   
6. **Eigenvectors of the Gaussian Covariance Matrix**:
   - Generate samples, compute covariance matrices, and plot eigenvectors for a given distribution.
   
7. **Gaussian Classifiers for Digits and Spam**:
   - Implement and compare Gaussian classifiers for digit recognition and spam detection using MNIST and SPAM datasets respectively.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/4hmdhb/ml-classifiers.git
   cd ml-classifiers
   ```

2. Ensure all dependencies are installed. You can use `pip` to install required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
   ```

### Running the Code

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure that the data files are placed in the `data/` directory.
   
2. **Training and Prediction**:
   - Run the Python scripts to train the models and generate predictions.
   - For example, to generate predictions for the MNIST dataset, run:

     ```sh
     python scripts/check.py
     ```

3. **Generating Submission Files**:
   - Save the predictions to CSV files for Kaggle submission using:

     ```sh
     python scripts/save_csv.py
     ```

### Kaggle Submission

- Submit the CSV files generated in the previous step to the respective Kaggle competitions:
  - [MNIST Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs189-hw3-mnist-spring-2024/)
  - [SPAM Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs189-hw3-spam-spring-2024/)
